# Budget Schedules

## Purpose

Takes various budget schedules and calculates their daily values.

As an example, a $70 weekly budget would have 7 days and $10 per day. However, a monthly budget might have anywhere from 28 days to 31 days, depending on the day/month. Also, when you start a budget, you'll need the full amount for the first payment, and may have some variable number of days between when you're aware of the budget and your first payment.

## Features

This accommodates daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly budget schedules.
